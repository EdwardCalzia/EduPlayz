# EduPlayz

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind EduPlayz was to find a way to make studying more enjoyable and to help students retain information better. We created the project out of our own experience of finding it easy to spend hours playing games, but struggling to focus on past papers and quizzes. The idea was to combine the two by gamifying educational quizzes, resulting in people playing them for longer and learning more.

## What it does
EduPlayz is a website with a collection of minigames, each testing the user on a different aspect of chemistry. We designed the games to be fun and engaging, and cover a range of topics such as the elements, oxidation states , and more. Each game has a different set of rules and objectives, making the experience more varied and interesting for the user.

## How we built it
We built the EduPlayz website using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with some games using p5js. We also created a landing page where the user can choose which game they would like to play. We spent a lot of time testing and debugging the code to ensure that each game worked as intended.
## Challenges we ran into
While building EduPlayz, we ran into several challenges. One of the main issues was getting the CSS to create a row instead of a column. We also had difficulties with more complex versions of the games not working as intended, which required additional testing and debugging. Additionally, we faced permission issues when trying to view files without using a server.

## What we learned
Working on EduPlayz taught us a lot about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was the largest JavaScript project we had worked on, so we gained a deeper understanding of how it works. We also learned a lot about time management, and the importance of setting realistic goals and managing our time effectively to complete the project on time.

## What's next for EduPlayz
We have big plans for the future of EduPlayz. We hope to add more minigames across different subjects and to incorporate additional features that will enhance the user experience. By making learning fun and engaging, we believe we can help students of all ages and backgrounds to develop a love for learning and achieve their academic goals.
